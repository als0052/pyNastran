pyNastran.op2.op2.OP2:
  - OP2().read_op2() doesn't accept Path objects. Seems to only like strings?
  - debug=False causes errors?
  - "WARNING: op2_reader.py:5754 nx version='12.0.1' is not supported"
  - runs very slow in Jupyter Lab notebook via miniconda
    - probably nothing I can do about this

README.rst:
  - probably needs to be updated eventually. Don't actually know if it is outdated

README.md:
  - probably needs to be updated eventually. Don't actually know if it is outdated

requirements_docs.txt: 
  - can the contents of this be mergec into requirements.txt? 
  - Or are the files separate to avoid installing packages only needed for documentation editing?
pyNastran.utils.py: >
    WARNING: Could not import class or module 'pyNastran.utils.dict_to_h5py' specified for inheritance diagram
    WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'dict_to_h5py' from module 'pyNastran.utils'; the following exception was raised: No module named 'h5py'
