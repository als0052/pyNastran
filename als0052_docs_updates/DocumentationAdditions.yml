# This file is a separate set of things from the ``IssuesToFix.yaml`` file   #
# create by the same author (als0052). That file contains things which are   #
# straight up broken. This file contains optional additions that would       #
# enhance the functionality and/or utility of PyNastran.                     #
#                                                                            #
# The values in this file are entered as YAML dictionaries, where the keys   #
# of the dictionary can be contatenated to form the path to the directory    #
# where the addition should be made.                                         #
